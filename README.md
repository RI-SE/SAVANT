# SAVANT
Development repository for RISE SAVANT - Semi-automated video annotation toolkit
![SAVANT logo](./savant_app/src/savant_app/frontend/assets/savant_logo.png)

```diff
- This repository is for development so we can add references and other stuff used temporarily. Will move the relevant parts to a new repo in the Rise org when there is something working which we want to release later.
